<h1>Analyzing The Impact of (AI) Artificial Intelligence on Social Media Platform</h1>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. It enables machines to learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and perform tasks that mimic human capabilities. With this ability, it has significantly impacted our way of life by automating tasks that were once burdensome for humans. 
<p>Futhermore, it is also extensively utilized on social media platforms to analyze content, automatically remove disturbing materials, implement algorithms, and more.

<h1>Social Media Platform - Facebook </h1>
<p>Facebook, a social media platform launched on February 4, 2004, quickly became a hit in the market. With Facebook, relationship building is facilitated through its in-built communication tools, allowing users to share posts and stories to update people they care about, among other features.

<h1>A student shares her experience on Facebook as she was an early user of the platform: </h1>
<p>“During the early years of Facebook, there were not as many limitations as there are today. Disturbing content and comments were more prevalent, and the reaction tools were not as advanced as they are today. 
While I appreciate the updates that have made the Facebook community safer, I've noticed an increase in limitations and restrictions. This reduces my ability to share posts, react voluminously to posts, and so on. Multiple actions can now lead to my account being locked or restricted from performing any actions.”

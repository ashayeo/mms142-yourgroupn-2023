  <li> <h3>Pre-moderation</h3>
   Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), businesses can proactively analyze content for adherence to guidelines, automatically rejecting material that contains offensive or threatening language. This method minimizes the reliance on human moderators by swiftly identifying and handling content that violates preset criteria.
  </li> 
  <li> <h3>Post-moderation</h3>
  This approach allows users to post content in real-time without undergoing pre-moderation. Subsequently, a moderator reviews the content after it's posted. Users may encounter content that breaches community guidelines before a moderator intervenes to block or remove it.
  </li>
  <li> <h3>Reactive moderation</h3>
   In this method, users take on the role of moderators, evaluating posts against their community standards to determine compliance. This crowd-sourced approach leverages the community itself for content moderation, reducing the necessity for dedicated human moderators.
